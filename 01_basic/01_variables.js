// in js we have 3 ways to declare variables 1.By "const" keyword  2. By "let" keyword  3. By "var" keyword 

const schoolId=1249; // this cant be change as this initialise by const keyword 
let myName="shubham sharma"; // we mostly time we use this initialisation in js
var mybrotherName="shivam sharma" // in this we face scope problem 
 

console.table([schoolId,myName,mybrotherName]);
